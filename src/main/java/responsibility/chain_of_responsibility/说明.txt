职责链模式(Chain of Responsibility)
Introduction：
The Chain of Responsibility pattern uses a chain of objects to handle a request,
which typically an event. Objects in the chain forward the request along the chain 
until one of the objects handle the event.Processing stops after an event is handled.

The intend:
1.The intend of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is to avoid coupling the sender request
to its receiver , by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.Chain the 
receiving object and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

2.The intend of the Chain of Responsibility is to relieve callers from knowing which object
can handle a request.

Summary:
1.The Chain of Responsibility helps to simplify client code when it's not obvious which object
in a group should handle the request.

2.With the classic CoR pattern, one or none of the objects in the chain handles the event;
if an object doesn't handle the event, it forwards it to the next object in the chain.



Client----request-->>>>handler1-----request-->>>handler2--->>>handler n.


The Chain of Responsibility is applicable if:
1.You want to decouple a request's sender and the receiver.
2.Multiple objects,determined at runtime ,are candidates to handle the request.
3.You don't want to specify handlers explicitly in your code.

If you use the CoR pattern,remember:
1.Only one object in the chain handles the request.
2.Some request might not get handled.
Those restriction,of course, are a classic CoR implementation.In practice,
those rules are bent; for example, servlet filters are a CoR implementation
that allows multiple filters to process an HTTP request.


A simple Servlet 
You must do three things to filter a servlet:
1.Implement a servlet
2.Implement a filter
3.Associate the filter and the servlet
