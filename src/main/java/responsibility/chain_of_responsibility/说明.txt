职责链模式(Chain of Responsibility)
1.The intend of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is to avoid coupling the sender request
to its receiver , by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.

2.The intend of the Chain of Responsibility is to relieve callers from knowing which object
can handle a request.

The Chain of Responsibility helps to simplify client code when it's not obvious which object
in a group should handle the request.
