/**
 * The CoR pattern was not applicable for AWT events because GUI events are much
 * too fine-grained; because there are so many events, and components handle
 * them so frequently, the CoR pattern resulted in an explosion of subclassesâ€”an
 * average GUI could easily have upwards of 50 component subclasses for the
 * single purpose of handling events. Finally, propagation of events was rarely
 * used; typically, events are handled by the component in which they
 * originated.
