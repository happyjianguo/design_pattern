1.Introduction
A Strategy is a plan, or approach,for achieving an aim given certain input 
conditions.A strategy is thus similar to an algorithm, a procedure that 
produces an output from a set of inputs.

The intend of Strategy is to encapsulate alternative approaches , or 
strategy, in separate classes that each implement a common operation.

The Strategy Pattern helps to organize and simplify code by encapsulate 
different approaches to a problem in different classes.
