in the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)'s early days, 
some servlet containers provided a handy feature known as servlet chaining,
whereby one could essentially apply a list of filters to a servlet. 
Servlet filters are popular because they're useful for 
security, compression, logging, and more. 
And, of course, you can compose a chain of filters to do some 
or all of those things depending on runtime conditions.

With the advent of the Java Servlet Specification version 2.3,
filters became standard components. Unlike classic CoR, 
servlet filters allow multiple objects (filters) in a chain to handle a request.
